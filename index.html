      devdocs.io is a good place to look up tags and their attributes. Attributes for <b><i>hr</i></b> are <b>size</b> and <b>noshade</b>.

      <!--Comments are invisible and are structured like this-->
      <center>Use <b>center</b> to center the structure of the page.</center>

      <p>Today I built my personal site with html in atom. The HTML Boilerplate is like a template that will appear when you start typing your html code. The <strong>meta charset</strong> in the head of the html identifies the how the text in the html website
        will be encoded. UTF-8 is the most used encoding system. The <em>emphasis tag = em</em> should be used instead of the <i>italicized tag = i</i> because when it will show <em>emphasis</em> of the text instead of style. The same way with the <strong>strong tag = strong</strong>        being used instead of the <b>bold tag = b.</b>
        <p>
          <p>There are ordered lists = ol that create numbered lists and unordered lists = ul that create bullet points. The items in these lists must be surrounded with "li".</p>
          <p>Images start with "img" and have an attribute "src" that will show the source of the image. Image sources can be urls or images already in the computer's folders. The image tag is self closing. "alt" is a place for text to appear if the image
            doesn't load on the webpage. Example:
            < img src="Hello Mom.jpg" alt="Picture of Mom"></p>
          <p>Links are not self closing.
            < a hef="https//..."> Example Website Text
              < / a> We can also create links to other pages within our website folder. We just need to create new files within it and make links to connect them.</p>
